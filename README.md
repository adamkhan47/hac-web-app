# hac-web-app
hac web app will be my first ever frontend and backend app that preferably is self hosted to get your grades

# must read
- this app stores login in plaintext, no end to end encryption
- if you want to use scraper.js in your own hac api scraper, give credits :)

# how to install
- need node js
clone repo, then run npm install and node server.js

# plans
- tailwind css maybe?
- nice app
- integration with my what if grade calculator
- encryption possibly
- more coming soon

# done
- basic API app
- able to talk to any hac api you want
- multiple user support (somewhat)
